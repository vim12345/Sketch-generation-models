# Sketch-generation-models
# Description:
Sketch generation is the task of converting a real image into a sketch or line drawing that approximates the content of the original image. This process is useful for artistic applications, image-to-sketch conversion, and style transfer tasks. Generative models like GANs or Autoencoders can be used to learn the mapping from real images to their corresponding sketches. In this project, we will explore how to generate sketches from images using a pre-trained model.

# ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Sketch Generation):
We'll use a pre-trained model to convert images into sketches. Specifically, we will use a neural network trained to create sketches from images, and we can apply this model using a simple image-to-sketch transformation approach.

# âœ… What It Does:
* Generates a sketch from a real image by passing it through a pre-trained neural network (e.g., trained on a dataset of images and sketches).

* Uses image preprocessing (resizing, normalization) to match the model's input requirements.

* Displays both the original image and its generated sketch side by side for comparison.

# Key features:
* Image-to-sketch conversion can be applied to any real image, converting it into an artistic sketch.

* This implementation assumes the availability of a pre-trained sketch generation model, which can be replaced with other models like pix2pix or CycleGAN for more advanced results.
